      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Located just outside the historic town of Falmouth, Swamp Safari was created to
        give visitors a safe, guided way to experience a Caribbean wetland. Over the years,
        it has grown into a popular eco-tourism stop, known for its crocodile exhibits,
        boardwalk trails and scenic swamp views.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, the attraction works closely with local guides and environmental partners
        to share accurate information about Jamaica’s native species and the importance of
        wetland conservation.
